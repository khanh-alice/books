# Chapter 2: Variables and Basic Types

## Exercises

### Exercise 2.1

* `int`, `long`, `long long`, and `short` are all integer types. The difference between them is their size. `short`'s
  minimum size is 16 bits, `int`'s minimum size is 16 bits, `long`'s minimum size is 32 bits, and `long long`'s minimum
  size is 64 bits.

* An unsigned type can only represent values greater than or equal to zero. A signed type can represent both positive
  and negative values.

* `float` and `double` are both floating-point types. `float` is usually 32 bits and `double` is usually 64 bits.

### Exercise 2.2

To calculate a mortgage payment, we would use `double` for the rate, principal, and payment. It is because all of these
can be a decimal number.

### Exercise 2.3

The output would be:

```console
32
4294967264
32
-32
0
